## Install python requirements

We recommend using `virtualenv` to setup a virtual environment in this directory.
We have to use Python 2.7, so please try the following to setup your environment:

    pip2.7 install virtualenv
    virtualenv -p `which python2.7` .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Details to setup opencv properly follow when we need it.
