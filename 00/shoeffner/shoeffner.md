## Helmholtz's experiment and covert attention

Hermann von Helmholtz's experiment (either 1894 (sheet), 1896 [@tsotsos], or
1967 [@carrasco]) demonstrated that it is possible to shift attention without
eye movements [@tsotsos].

In the experiment participants had to stare into an apparatus similar to a pinhole camera with two pinholes. They had to focus their eyes at two
pinholes and keep them aligned. Then they had to focus, without moving their
eyes, on a dark area inside the pinhole apparatus, so that they could
identify objects when a little spark would lighten up the box. [@carrasco] This
shift of attention to areas without active eye movements is called covert
attention.


## Early selection (Broadbent)

Donald Broadbent proposed a filter model for attention. By describing sensory
input as information to process he proposed that only limited parts of it can
be processed at once. This led to the theory that a filter has to be in
place to select the information which will be processed. A useful filter seems to be a goal-oriented selection of data, to guarantee that only important data is processed. [@wiki:broadbent]

There are two different models for this kind of filted: early and late selection filters. In the early selection model ...
In contrast, in the late selection model, ... [@wiki:broadbent]


## Yarbus's records of eye movement

Yarbus introduced a novel method to record eye movements. He employed about
ten different kinds of suction devices (caps) for different purposes (e.g.
experiments with images stationary relative to the retina) as well as
different light sources and various photosensitive recording materials like
film. He used his testing apparatus to research saccades in exploration of
natural scenes and objects.  [@yarbus, esp. chapters I, IV, VII]


## Treisman's Feature Integration Theory

The Feature Integration Theory (FIT) states that not only top-down processes
are important for attention and perception (a view found e.g. in the Gestalt
laws, where the perception of the whole comes before its decomposition into
parts). Instead, bottom-up processes are also part of perception: features
like orientation, color, brightness, and more are sensed and combined
(integrated) before they are mentally perceived as a whole. However, it makes
sense to perceive objects as a whole without consciously realizing their
parts to be able to reason about our environment. [@treisman]

## Overt and covert attention

Overt attention is achieved by actively moving one's eyes to the object of
interest, while covert attention is an attention shift which does not involve
eye movement. [@wiki:attention]

There are different theories arguing whether covert and overt attention are dependent on each other or independent. In 1980 Klein proposed that they are independent but occur simultaneously as they are both driven by visual cues [@tsotsos]. Later (in 2004) Klein was convinced that covert attention precedes overt attention, still both could be driven by similar external stimuli (exogenous attention). [@tsotsos]


## Exogenous and endogenous attention

Attention is considered exogenous if it is controlled through an external
process, likewise it is considered endogenous if controlled through an
internal process. In general exogenous process also employ an endogenous
component, since an external stimulus is considered to only cause a shift in
attention if it is important to the subject [@wiki:attention].
